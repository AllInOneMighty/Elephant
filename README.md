## Solution to chat loss annoyance

**Elephant** logs the chat for you in the background __even when you get
disconnected__. It saves the WHISPER & BATTLE.NET, RAID, INSTANCE & BATTLEGROUND,
PARTY, GUILD, SAY, YELL and OFFICER chats separately, but also all *general
chats* (General, Trade, LocalDefense, ...), *custom chats* you are currently on,
*achievements*, *loots* and finally *system* messages (auctions, rolls, server
going down, ...). You can easily go through all these logs, thanks to a
straightforward interface displaying all the access buttons on the right side of
the main window. You can access the options of the addon by typing /elephant and
also bind a key to pop up the addon.

**Elephant** gives you the ability to copy up to 100,000 (yes, 100k) characters
of logs to another application. A BBCode feature is even included, letting you
copy/paste a chat with *colors* and *links to an item database* in a very quick
and simple way to your favorite forum.

This is *THE* addon that you should install if you want to never forget what
somebody told you in game. Be a pro of managing hell tells, go peacefully AFK
for a few minutes, or be an awesome role player. **Elephant** is also perfectly
designed for Guild Leaders, Officers and Raid Leaders particularly because it
restores the chats after you've been disconnected.

## Main features

* Logs the chats in the background, with a limit of 10,000 lines for each chat
  (Blizzard's default is 161 lines for everything).
* Saves the logs when you log out or get disconnected.
* Display the chats with timestamps, or using your Prat settings if you have it
  installed.
* Copy the chat and paste it in other applications (BBCode supported!), up to
  100,000 characters.
* Save the chat and combat log in two different files on your computer (using
  the default Blizzard logging system).

### Other features

* Use filters to avoid logging some of the custom channels you join.
* Enable/disable logging for each chat separately.
* Item links in logs are displayed in their proper color and are clickable.
* Player names in the main window are clickable.
* ...and much more!
